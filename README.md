- Hello, I'm @Anatolius33

 - I love learning new things. I am interested in science, 
    programming and ultra-high technologies of all mankind
    in the world and various alternatives of universes… 
    One wise man once said: “A thought or a new idea becomes obsolete after a minute.” 
    So there should be an upgrade every minute. 
    I try to follow this ... I'm not looking for easy ways ...

 - 🌱 I am currently studying the python programming language,
       creating small projects, 
       trying to improve the codes of programs I have written ...

 - 💞️ I invite you to cooperate ...

 - 📫 Here is my email: nemo028c@gmail.com… I will be very glad to cooperate.
